      <p>The movie untitled « The End of Evangelion is a 85 minutes long movie, that conclude the animation serie « Neon Genesis Evangelion », writen by Hideaki Anno. That movie is known for having a lot of hype during his production, because most of the viewers did not understood the last episodes of the serie. </p>
      <p>A spoiler alert is needed : if you want to enjoy fully the movie, seeing it first may help you before reading the following content !</p>

      <p>The movie is happening at the end of that anime, in which we follow the story of Shinji Ikari, a young teenager growing in a futuristic Japan where dangerous creatures, called Angels, wants to destroy the country by their divine powers. Shinji will pilot a weapon made by humans to counter these Angels : An Evangelion, a kind of big mecha, a robot, that may defend Japan and its citizen. He will be assissted by others pilot, such Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley, and they will face these new ennemies and their fears, in a psychologic story, full of twists and mysteries.</p>

      <p>This being said: here is the synopsis of this animated movie ! After the death of an important angel that caused a lot of damages in Tokyo, an organisation try to bring a ancient cataclysm, that could eradicate the entire human race : the Third Impact, that could kill every living thing on Earth. Our protagonist is lost, Shinji has killed one of his best friend, the angel mentionned sooner, and the two other pilots have a psychological crisis.</p>

      <p>In that dark age, the future of humanity seems writen, the last hope of the humanity are the Evangelions. Our favorite characters will have to counter this threat, despite the mental difficulties they met : after epic fights, existential thoughts and high reflexion, the apocalypse is happening, all the humans consciousness are mixed up, in an new god, and the world fade in a craziness that each viewers can freely interprete.</p> 

      <p>The movie ends on a plan of Asuka and Shinji looking at a red sea, under a sky full of stars, the head of this new god is floating away in that red ocean. This last  picture is the same we can see on the film poster, before even entering the cinema. The fans have either seen the best story of all the franchise, either a treason to the serie, giving a bad conclusion that does not satisfy them.</p>

      <p>This movie is a masterpiece of animation, which uses the genre of the Mecha to rework it and adding a philosophical and tragic side to it, which was really innovating when the movie came out, in 1997. At the same time, the science-fiction started to integrate the pop-culture, we can see the expansion of huge artificial cities, some robots that reach big heights (over 10 meters), all of this on the life of a young man that have a lot of questions. This is the reason why The End of Evangelion is a classic movie in science-fiction.</p>
