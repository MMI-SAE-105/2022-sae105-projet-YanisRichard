    <p>This place is an iconic place of the 70’s science-fiction, because it has inspired a scene from the biggest licence with Star Trek and Stargate : we are talking about Star Wars, of course, THE reference in matter of droids, space ships and futuristic weapon such as the lightsaber.</p>
    <p>During the making of the third movie « The Return of the Jedi », this forest usd as a reference to the Endor planet, the refuge of Ewoks, that helped the Rebels against the Empire.</p>

    <p>This forest have the particularity of being one of the richest in the world, with trees that reaches more than hundreds of meters, and old of 2000 years, which makes it the perfect place to film a jungle, since the proportions seems unreal.</p>
    <p>This place is located in North California, next to Oregon, and covers 534 km² of forest, it is a palce visited by many fans of Star Wars, and it it part of the world patrimony of UNESCO since 1980.</p>
    <p>The story of that forest begins in the 1850’s years, when it covered more than 8100 km², it attracted a lot of americans lumberjacks, until the 20’s, when an organisation, the «Save the Redwood League » decided to protest and save what remains of that forest.</p>

    <p>Since that event, the parc was open un 1968, being a natural reserve for the local biosphere, si it is not rare to see local species, such as stained owl.</p>
    <p>By its localisation, the climate is warm and humid, that gives a permanent brume, essential to the development of the local animals. It is in this forest that the highest tree in the world reigns : Hyperion, the sequoia of 115,5 meters, rules this domain since more of 800 years. Most of the trees that were cut from the forest were used to build houses in San Francisco.</p>
