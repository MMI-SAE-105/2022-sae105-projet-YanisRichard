    <p>The iconic duo that is Daft Punk, known for their electro-music, has made a song, « Something About Us », in a very particular context.</p>
    <p>The two robots are making their second album, intitled « Discovery » in 2001, and works in a parallel project : a movie with Leiji Matsumoto, the creator of Albator, the Space Pirate. </p>
    
    <img src="../public/img/images-DaftPunk/Daft_Punk_-_Discovery_1.webp">
    
    <p>The project will be named Interstella 5555, and is an animation-movie, almost mute, only the soundtrack can be heard, like the movie « Fantasia 2000 » from the Walt Disney Company. Thus, the album of the french band becacme a movie where action, rythm and emotion are mixed up to give an incredible of 68 minutes, enjoyable to look and listen.</p>

    <p>The movie itself tell the story of an alien music band that arrive on our planet, they are chased by a an evil music producer, and try to escape him in the galaxy. This scenario is typical from a science-fiction movie of that time, it sticked with the image of Daft Punk, that presented themselves as robots producing music, doing an electric genre, so there already was a vibe of that science-fiction since the creation of the group.</p>
    <p>The song « Something About Us » is about a love confession, in the clip of the movie, it plays when one of the protagonist is at agony, having protected the wife he loved from a deadly bullet. The character try to tell a last message to the love of his life, to leave with a clear consciousness and tell her a final goodbye.</p>

    <p> This song shows perfectly the regret of leaving a dear beloved, while passing a message of unlimited and simple love. It is a beautiful leaving and loving message : the music is sweet, the lyrics are easy to understand, and the voice is calm, it is one of the song that use a real voice to sing the lyrics, and it gives something relaxing to this music. The voice makes us accept the fate of the character, the scene became less sad, and leave a beautiful epitaph on the grave of the alien singer.</p>
