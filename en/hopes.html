    <p>The nature of the science-fiction, from a first aspect, may be pretty simple and childish, one  example of typic clichés could be some big machines fighting space ships on another planet, with laser beam and fantastic weapons. These kind of clichés are often used to illustrate some productions such as Goldorak, Star Wars or Transformers, which is a pretty reductive conclusion to these movies and series.
    <p>The science-fiction is a genre, often cricticized for a lack of realism and seriousness, despite some to most of the genre can prove the opposite, like the cinematographic saga that « Alien » represents by example. This critical remark allow us to ask a well-known question : What will tomorrow be made of ?</p>

    <p>The science-fiction tries to answer it, by the way an artist or a producer see the future : for George Lucas, the Star Wars daddy, it is an age where space ships are omnipresents, the conflicts are solved by lightsaber duels, and the society is controled by strong federations. This vision of the world is not that far from us, with Elon Musk and his company, SpaceX, trying to reach and colonize Mars in the next decades.</p> <p>Cette vision du monde peut s’envisager à l’heure actuelle, avec les nombreux lancements des fusées d’Elon Musk, patron de SpaceX, visant à coloniser Mars dans les prochaines décennies. Ce genre d’aperçu n’est pas tout à fait possible, mais il paraît moins impossible aujourd’hui qu’il y a 40 ans.</p>
    <p>A future that have evolved at this point is not really possible for now, but it seems less impossible today than 40 years back in the past. Another innnovation, an actual one, is the virtual reality : even in the early 2000’s , we could not imagine that it could take such an important  place in our life, through games, movies and even social media (Vr chat by example), it is a science-fiction dream that came real, being able to immerse itself in a virtual world, that is a pretty big advancement in technology. </p>

    <p>All of this gives us matter to think about the possibility of a future described by a fictional universe, after all, we evolve constantly un a world of technology, its impact may be feeled by anyone, through connected items or modern protheses that helps people to a higher level.</p>
    <p>Thus, the science-fiction seems less far from our reality, and may gives us the hope of a world where technology, at humanity’s service, will upgrade the human to help him in every aspects of life, by protheses or 3D printed objects for now, and maybe by better inventions later.</p>
