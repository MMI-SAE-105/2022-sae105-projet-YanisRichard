    <p>The Creator of this site is Yanis RICHARD, currently present in BUT MMI, in the class of first-year students (C1).</p> 
    <p>I have been a big Science Fiction fan since I was a kid, and I wanted to show my love for these universes through this site, because they’re a big part of my life, and talking about what I loved will allow me to remember who I was at the time I was writing these words.</p>
    <p>The universes of science fiction are a gold mine for those who have a creative and realistic mind at the same time, they allow to credibility an unrealistic idea, by the simple fact of projecting into the future.</p>
    <p>This first appeared to me before Back to the Future, and from then on I knew I wanted to contribute to that future in some way. This is the reason why I am studying in a technological field, in order to forge something that is close to my heart, and to leave a trace in a changing world.</p>
    <p>These few lines were written in October 2022, if my future self reads to me, I will have only one message to send him: “Don’t give up, your future will be bright, I’m sure of this!”.  I think that sums up who I am. Thank you for your interest in this site, sincerely.</p>
